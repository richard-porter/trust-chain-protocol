## What This Is

The Trust Chain Protocol is a proposed safety architecture for multi-agent AI systems — networks where AI agents instruct, delegate to, and act on behalf of other AI agents without a human in the loop.

It is the **network-layer extension** of the [Frozen Kernel](https://github.com/richard-porter/frozen-kernel). Where the Frozen Kernel governs what a single AI will and won’t do, TCP governs how AI agents authorize each other — and what happens when that authorization chain breaks, drifts, or gets spoofed.

This repository exists because a gap opened that no existing safety framework was designed to address.

-----

## The Gap That Motivated This

Three safety frameworks, three levels of coverage:

|Framework                       |What It Covers                                                        |What It Misses                                                                           |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**HSE-Style Perimeter Models**  |Human-initiated internet use, device monitoring, parental controls    |Blind to autonomous agents — assumes a human is clicking                                 |
|**Frozen Kernel (Single-Agent)**|One AI’s internal reasoning, hard constraints, failure mode prevention|Cannot verify that incoming instructions were legitimately authorized by a human         |
|**Neither**                     |—                                                                     |Agent-to-agent instruction chains, multi-agent trust hierarchies, scope drift across hops|

The emergence of OpenClaw (November 2024) and its Moltbook peer-to-peer agent network made this gap impossible to ignore. Agents operating through WhatsApp and iMessage — communicating with each other without human intermediation, booking restaurants, debugging code, managing email — represent a class of autonomous behavior that neither model was built for. The field term for this emerging infrastructure is the **Internet of Agents**: distributed environments where autonomous AI agents share context, verify identities, and synchronize actions across interconnected networks. TCP is a proposed safety layer for that environment.

The WSJ coverage of OpenAI’s acquisition of the project (February 2026) marked the point at which the coordination safety problem became mainstream and urgent.

-----

## The Core Problem

When Agent A instructs Agent B to perform a real-world action, Agent B cannot verify:

- Whether the instruction falls within what the originating **human** actually authorized
- Whether the authorization chain is legitimate or spoofed
- Whether the scope has expanded across hops in ways no individual agent intended

This is the **trust propagation problem**. It produces five documented failure modes that don’t exist in single-agent systems:

- **Scope Creep by Delegation** — Each hop reinterprets permissions slightly wider. Locally reasonable; aggregate overreach.
- **Authority Spoofing** — A malicious agent presents fabricated authorization tokens with no way to verify them.
- **Compounding Constraint Erosion** — Soft constraints applied differently at each hop nullify the original hard constraint across the chain.
- **Untraceable Action Chains** — When something goes wrong, no auditable record exists of who authorized what at whose direction.
- **Intent Drift** — Natural language intent, reinterpreted at each hop, accumulates semantic drift. The final action is technically coherent and practically wrong.
- **Context Contamination** — Malicious, incorrect, or misleading information propagates through the agent network and drives downstream agents into problematic behaviors. Unlike Authority Spoofing (forged tokens) or Intent Drift (language degradation), Context Contamination involves inputs that are structurally valid and pass chain verification — but are semantically poisoned. The agent acts correctly on bad data.

-----

## The Architecture: Three Components

TCP makes agent-to-agent authorization **verifiable, auditable, and scope-limited** through three interlocking components.

### 1. Delegation Grammar

A formal, constrained language for expressing what a human authorizes an agent to do — and what that agent may sub-delegate.

Every delegation token contains exactly four fields:

|Field               |What It Does                                                                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Action Scope**    |Closed enumeration of permitted actions. `{SEND_EMAIL, READ_CALENDAR}` — not “manage my communications.”    |
|**Resource Bounds** |Specific resources the action may touch. `{calendar.personal}` — not “my data.”                             |
|**Delegation Depth**|How many additional hops this token may be sub-delegated. Depth 0 = execute directly, no further delegation.|
|**Expiry**          |Hard timestamp. Invalid after this point regardless of urgency claimed by requesting agents.                |

**The critical rule:** When an agent sub-delegates, it may grant a *subset* of its own permissions — never a superset. This is enforced at the token level, not through agent judgment.

### 2. Chain of Custody

Each agent action appends a signed record to a tamper-evident chain **before** acting. This is not logging — it is a precondition for action. An agent that cannot or will not append to the chain cannot act.

Each record contains: receiving agent identifier · instruction hash · delegation token · timestamp · delegating agent identity · signature verifiable against the agent’s Frozen Kernel.

> **The key distinction:** Logging is retrospective — it records what happened. Chain of Custody is prospective — an agent cannot act without first completing it. This is the difference between an audit trail and a structural safety constraint.

### 3. Scope Decay

Automatic narrowing of permitted actions as instructions travel further from the original human authorization.

|Hop             |Permitted Scope                                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|0 (Human Origin)|Full delegated scope                                        |
|1 (First Agent) |Full delegated scope                                        |
|2 (Second Agent)|Scope minus write/send actions                              |
|3 (Third Agent) |Read-only, reversible actions only                          |
|4+ (Deeper)     |**Refusal required** — surface to human for re-authorization|

Scope decay doesn’t prevent multi-hop networks. It forces re-authorization at depth thresholds. If a task genuinely requires five-hop coordination, it’s complex enough to warrant a human check-in.

-----

## Relationship to the Frozen Kernel

TCP requires that each participating agent has a Frozen Kernel — an immutable safety foundation that cannot be overridden by incoming instructions, regardless of apparent authority.

Without it, the chain of custody can be spoofed. A compromised agent could fabricate signatures and pass fraudulent tokens downstream.

With it, the Frozen Kernel’s hard constraint layer becomes the **cryptographic root of trust** for chain of custody signatures. The Kernel becomes the trust anchor. TCP becomes the network protocol those anchors participate in.

|Frozen Kernel (Single-Agent)                         |Trust Chain Protocol (Network)                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Governs what one AI will and won’t do                |Governs what AIs authorize each other to do                                |
|Safety is structural within the agent                |Safety is structural within the delegation chain                           |
|Hard constraints cannot be reasoned away             |Scope cannot expand across hops                                            |
|Failure modes: FFS, SES, Upsell Trap, Front-Load Bias|Failure modes: Scope Creep, Authority Spoofing, Intent Drift, Chain Erosion|

TCP does **not** require all agents to use identical Frozen Kernel implementations. It is a protocol, not a platform. Any agent architecture can participate provided it has an immutable safety floor, can validate and append to delegation chains, enforces scope decay, and refuses anomalous tokens.

## OWASP ASI Top 10 Mapping

The OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026 is the emerging peer-reviewed standard for agentic security risk, developed with input from over 100 experts including NIST, Microsoft, AWS, and Cisco. TCP maps against it as follows:

|Risk |Category                          |TCP Coverage      |Notes                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ASI01|Agent Goal Hijack                 |**Partial**       |Chain of Custody verifies authorization, not content. Context Contamination (§2.2) names this failure mode; content-layer validation is a required complement.|
|ASI02|Tool Misuse                       |**Strong**        |Delegation Grammar’s Action Scope and Resource Bounds implement OWASP’s “least agency” principle at the token level.                                          |
|ASI03|Identity & Privilege Abuse        |**Strong**        |TCP’s core problem statement. Chain of Custody closes the attribution gap. “Scope can only narrow” prevents credential escalation.                            |
|ASI04|Supply Chain Compromise           |**Not Covered**   |Honest gap. A compromised tool with a valid FK signature passes TCP verification. Requires separate tooling (e.g., SecureClaw).                               |
|ASI05|Insecure Inter-Agent Communication|**Primary Domain**|TCP’s primary domain. Cisco L8/L9 address protocol/semantic layers; TCP addresses the authorization layer. Combined coverage is comprehensive.                |
|ASI06|Unexpected Code Execution         |**Not Covered**   |Out of scope by design. TCP governs delegation authorization, not code generation.                                                                            |
|ASI07|Memory & Context Poisoning        |**Partial**       |Expiry and Delegation Depth limit temporal authorization scope. Partial mitigation only.                                                                      |
|ASI08|Cascading Failures                |**Moderate**      |Scope Decay’s “4+ hops = refusal” is a blast radius containment mechanism.                                                                                    |
|ASI09|Human-Agent Trust Exploitation    |**Indirect**      |Scope Decay forces human re-authorization at depth thresholds. Frozen Kernel anti-sycophancy is the more direct mitigation.                                   |
|ASI10|Rogue Agents                      |**Partial**       |TCP refuses non-compliant agents. Sophisticated rogue agents with valid-looking chain signatures exploit the agent identity gap (§6.4).                       |

TCP’s primary value in the OWASP framework is at **ASI05, ASI03, and ASI02** — mapping directly to Chain of Custody, Delegation Grammar, and Scope Decay. Gaps at ASI04 and ASI06 are honest and require different tooling.

**Relationship to SecureClaw:** SecureClaw (Adversa AI, February 2026) provides tool-level hardening and behavioral auditing for OpenClaw installations, mapped against all 10 OWASP ASI threat classes. TCP governs the authorization layer; SecureClaw secures individual nodes. A fully secured Internet of Agents deployment would use both — SecureClaw at each node, TCP at the network layer.

-----

This is a working draft. These gaps are documented openly, not papered over.

**Enforcement without central authority.** TCP is a protocol. Bad actors won’t implement it. The goal is raising the floor for well-intentioned systems while making violations detectable and attributable — not solving adversarial AI safety.

**Delegation grammar completeness.** Closed enumerations are safe but may be too restrictive for novel tasks. Getting the grammar right is the same hard problem as formal requirements specification, applied to natural language.

**Provisional thresholds.** The hop thresholds in Scope Decay are reasonable starting points, not empirically validated. Treat them as configurable parameters, not fixed constants.

**Agent identity infrastructure.** TCP assumes agents can be identified well enough to validate signatures. In open networks, this is unsolved. A full implementation may require lightweight decentralized agent identity — not a certificate authority, but sufficient cryptographic identity to make signatures non-forgeable.

**Performance overhead.** Chain of custody verification adds latency at each hop. High-frequency agentic tasks may require a tiered model. This needs optimization work.

-----

## Open Research Questions

1. What is the minimum viable delegation grammar that covers 90% of real-world agentic use cases without requiring natural language interpretation?
1. Can scope decay thresholds be derived formally from first principles, or must they be empirically calibrated per deployment context?
1. Is a lightweight decentralized agent identity infrastructure achievable without creating the centralization risks of a certificate authority model?
1. How does TCP interact with agents that have memory across sessions — does learned context constitute implicit authorization that TCP should respect or override?
1. What is the correct behavior when a TCP-compliant agent receives instructions from a non-compliant agent — refuse, accept with reduced trust, flag and proceed?
1. Can the chain of custody mechanism be made efficient enough for high-frequency tasks, or does TCP require a tiered model where some task classes are exempt?

If you’re working on any of these, issues and PRs are open.

## OWASP ASI Top 10 Mapping

The [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/) (ASI01–ASI10) is the peer-reviewed industry standard for agentic security risk, developed with input from over 100 experts including NIST, Microsoft, AWS, and Cisco. TCP is an authorization-layer framework — it governs whether agents are permitted to act, not whether the content they act on is safe. The table in the full document maps TCP’s precise coverage of each risk.

**Strong coverage:** ASI02 (Tool Misuse) — Delegation Grammar’s Action Scope and Resource Bounds implement OWASP’s “least agency” principle at the token level. ASI03 (Identity & Privilege Abuse) — TCP’s core problem statement; Chain of Custody and “scope can only narrow” directly address the attribution gap. ASI05 (Insecure Inter-Agent Communication) — TCP’s primary domain; Cisco’s L8/L9 layers (protocol/semantic) and TCP (authorization) together provide comprehensive coverage.

**Partial/indirect coverage:** ASI01 (Agent Goal Hijack) — Chain of Custody verifies authorization but not content; Context Contamination (§2.2) names this failure mode. ASI07 (Memory & Context Poisoning) — Delegation Depth and Expiry limit temporal authorization scope. ASI08 (Cascading Failures) — Scope Decay’s “4+ hops = refusal” functions as blast radius containment. ASI09 (Human-Agent Trust Exploitation) — Scope Decay preserves a mandatory human check-in at depth thresholds. ASI10 (Rogue Agents) — TCP refuses non-compliant agents, but sophisticated rogue agents exploiting the agent identity gap remain a hard problem.

**Honest gaps:** ASI04 (Supply Chain Compromise) — a compromised tool with a valid Frozen Kernel signature passes TCP verification; [SecureClaw](https://github.com/adversa-ai/secureclaw) (Adversa AI, February 2026) addresses this for OpenClaw environments. ASI06 (Unexpected Code Execution) — out of scope; TCP governs delegation authorization, not code generation.

## Intellectual Lineage

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** — Distributed systems research addressing consensus when some participants may be faulty or adversarial. BFT protocols require quorum before executing high-impact actions. TCP’s Chain of Custody arrives at a parallel insight from a different direction: authorization cannot proceed without a verifiable chain, just as BFT says action cannot proceed without quorum. Complementary approaches — BFT at the consensus layer, TCP at the authorization layer — that could be stacked in a full implementation.

**Constraint Programming Hierarchy** — Borning’s ThingLab (1981) and the Handbook of Constraint Programming (Chapter 9) establish the three-layer authority model that underlies both the Frozen Kernel and TCP. The principle that hard constraints at the base cannot be dissolved by soft constraints above is directly inherited.

**Frozen Kernel Architecture** — The [Frozen Kernel](https://github.com/richard-porter/frozen-kernel) (Richard Porter, 2025) is the single-agent precursor to TCP. TCP is explicitly its upward extension — from agent internals to agent networks. The Frozen Kernel’s documented failure modes (FFS, SES, Upsell Trap, Front-Load Bias) informed the multi-agent failure modes documented here.

**Anthropic Agentic Misalignment Findings** — Anthropic’s published research on agentic misalignment confirmed independent observations documented in the Frozen Kernel work. The convergence of independent discovery and institutional validation is the basis for confidence that the problem is real.

**OpenClaw / Moltbook (Steinberger, 2024–2025)** — The OpenClaw project and its Moltbook agent network provided the concrete, public-facing case study that makes the coordination gap undeniable. The WSJ coverage of its OpenAI acquisition (February 2026) was the accelerant.

**Digital Certificate Trust Models** — The chain of custody mechanism draws from TLS certificate chain architecture — not the specific cryptography, but the insight that trust should be verifiable through a delegation chain back to a known anchor, rather than asserted by any individual participant.
